### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on fixing dead reference links in the Metasploit Project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby. I have spent over a decade pretending it does not exist.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on offensive tooling for *nix.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Ruby. Specifically, the Metasploit flavour, and more specifically: writing mixins that perform post-exploitation actions. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about weird shit.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you don't for now. Drop a issue in this repo with contact info and I'll contact you?
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have at least 8 other Github profiles historically, I suck at managing passwords, so when I lose an accounts login or switch to a different computer I just make another one.
